All right Jim. Your quarterlies look very good. How are things at the library?
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.

I've, uh, I've been at Dunder Mifflin for 12 years, the last four as Regional Manager. If you want to come through here... See we have the entire floor. So this is my kingdom, as far as the eye can see. This is our receptionist, Pam. Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam Beesly. Pam has been with us for... forever. Right, Pam?
Well. I don't know.
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago. [growls]
What?
Any messages?
Uh, yeah. Just a fax.
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
You haven't told me.
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.

Whassup!
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Whassup!
Whassup!
Whass…up!
Whassup.
[Strains, grunts] What?
Nothing.
OK. All right. See you later.
All right. Take care.
Back to work.

Alright, was there anything you wanted to add to the agenda?
Um… Me no get an agenda.
What? I'm sorry?
I didn't get any agenda.
Well, I faxed one over to you this morning.
Really? I didn't... [looks at Pam] Did we get a fax this morning?
Uh, yeah, the one…
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
You put in the garbage can that was a special filing cabinet.
Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and. It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
Do you want to look at mine?
Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
OK. Since the last meeting, Ellen and the board have decided we can't justify a Scranton branch and a Stamford branch.
OK…
Michael, don't panic.
No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
No, no, no, Michael, listen OK. Don't panic. We haven't made… We haven't decided.
All the alarm bells are kind of going… ringie-dingie-ding!
I've spoken to Josh in Stamford. I've told him the same as you and it's up to either him or you to convince me that your branch can incorporate the other.
OK. No problem.
This does, however, mean that there is going to be downsizing.
Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?

Question. How long do we have to… [Telephone rings] Oh uh, Todd Packer, terrific rep. Do you mind if I take it?
Go ahead.
Packman.
Hey, you big queen.
Oh, that's not appropriate.
Hey, is old Godzillary coming in today?
Uh, I don't know what you mean.
I've been meaning to ask her one question. Does the carpet match the drapes?
Oh, my God! Oh! That's… horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
So do you think we could keep a lid on this for now? I don't want to worry people unnecessarily.
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office. [zips his lips] Like that.

Hey.
Hey.
This is Mr. Scott.
Guilty! Guilty as charged!
Ryan Howard from the temp agency. Daniqua sent me down to start today.
Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
Yup.
Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee! [hold hand up for a high five] Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler. [Continues with cod German]

You just still have these messages from yesterday.
Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it. [Imitating Six-Million Dollar Man sound effect]
What?
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
Don't we all?
I'm sorry?
Nothing.
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional. [Sighs]

Now I know there's some rumors out there and I just kind of want to set the record straight.
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
Can't you just tell us.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
You don't know what it is. [Laughs]
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
I don't need your permission.
Go ahead.
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.

Yeah but Michael, what if they downsize here?
Not gonna happen.
It could be out of your hands Michael.
It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
Can you promise that?
On his mother's grave.
No.
What?
Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
It's just that we need to know.
I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
I was in the meeting with Jan and she did say that it could be this branch that gets the axe.
Are you sure about that?
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
Pam, information is power.
You can't say for sure whether it'll be us or them, can you?
No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.

Watch out for this guy. Dwight Schrute in the building. This is Ryan, the new temp.
What's up? Nice to meet you.
Introduce yourself. Be polite.
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager.
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
Uh… yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
That's his profit.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.

Damn it! Jim!
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
[Laughing]
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.

What is that?
That is my stapler.
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world [turns to camera] which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
OK you know what, you can be a witness. [points to Ryan] Can you reprimand him?
How do you know it was me?
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
Discipline. Kinky! [Laughs] All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
Yeah.
And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
[Laughing] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
You should've put him in custardy.
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
Pudding. Pudding… I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.

So have you felt the vibe yet? We work hard, we play hard. Sometimes we play hard when we should be working hard. Right? I guess the atmosphere that I've created here is that I'm a friend first, and a boss second… and probably an entertainer third. [Knock at door] Just a second. Right? Oh, hey do you like The Jamie Kennedy Experiment? Punk'd and all that kind of stuff?
Yeah.
You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
All right.
Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to…
You got a fax.
Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
What? Why?
Why? Well, theft and stealing.
Stealing? What am I supposed to have stolen?
Post-it Notes.
Post-it Notes? What are those worth, 50 cents?
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit… margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Are you serious?
Yeah. I am.
I can't believe this. I mean I have never even stolen as much as a paperclip and you're firing me.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and… Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
[Pam starts crying] You been X'd punk! [Laughing] Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you… God, we totally got you.
You're a jerk.
I don't know about that.

Pam! Pam-Pam! Pam has been with us for… forever. Right, Pam?
I guess.
Yeah, at one time or another every guy in the office has sprayed on Pam.
What?
Messages?

Ah, right here. Three Stooges. High five. [Michael and Ryan high five] Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. [camera cuts to Pam then back to Michael] Now, who was the one before Curly?
Uh, Shemp.
Curly? Very good. Curly Joe DeRita.
Just Curly. Joe DeRita was different.
Well, comedy's kinda my thing. Watch this, here's Curly Joe. Mmm. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. Oh, I forgot. Here we go. [Yelling in cod German] I'm Hitler. Right. [Continues with cod German] Me, me, me, me, me, me. Curly Joe Hitler. [laughs]

What's that?
Wired.
Oh, John Belushi. What a crazy guy. Phew, freaked myself out this morning.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I thought I found a lump. I checked the, uh… I check the jewels every month. This time… You know, it's a little different. It was fine. It was fine. But freaky, man, you know. Testicular cancer, God. Cancer, whoa testicles. So… What's, um… What you eating?
Smoked turkey.
Oh, place around the corner. Nice. All right. See you later.

Hey, uh, can I help you out in here?
Oh, I'm all set, thanks.
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.

Hey, Oscar! How are you doing, man?
All right.
Did you have a good weekend going there?
It was fine.
Oh yeah, I bet it was fun. [to Mr. Brown] Oh, hey! This is Oscar—
Martinez.
Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
Great. We're all set.
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in… here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great.
Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
Thank you. Thank you very much. OK. Thanks for filling these out and I promise this'll be quick. At Diversity Today, our philosophy is about honesty and positive expectations. We believe that 99% of the problems in the workplace arise simply out of ignorance.
You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
Uh, see this is what I'm talking about. We don't have to pretend we're color-blind.
Exactly, were not…
That's fighting ignorance with more ignorance.
With tolerance.
No. With more ignorance.
Ignorance.
Right. Exactly. Uh, instead, we need to celebrate our diversity.
Let's celebrate.
Right. OK.
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
Yes, exactly. Now here's what we're going to do. I've noticed that…
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody… everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
I have two. White and Indian.
Actually, I'd prefer not to start that way. Michael, I would love to have your permission to run this session. Can I have your permission?
Yes.
Thank you very much. And it would also help me if you were seated.
OK.
Thank you. OK. Now, at the start of the session, I had you all write down an incident that you found offensive in the workplace. Now, what I'm going to do is choose one and we're going to act it out.
A few of the ground rules?
Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
OK, can we steer away from gay people?
Um…
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so…paradox.
Well, we only have an hour.
I figured it would save time.
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr…
Mr. Brown.
Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
Well, it's my name. It's not a test. OK? Um, so looking through the cards, I've noticed that many of you wrote down the same incident, which is ironic, because it's the exact incident I was brought in here to respond to. Now, how many of you are familiar with the Chris Rock routine? Very good. OK.

So we're going to reenact this with a more positive outcome.
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
Well, let's have someone who wasn't involved in the reenactment.
OK, I will play guy listening.
Great. Guy listening. Ok, anyone else remember?
I remember.
Great. You're the Chris Rock guy and you're guy listening.
OK.

Basically, there are two types of black people and black people are actually more racist because they hate the other type of black people. Every time the one type wants to have a good time, then the other type comes in and makes a real mess.
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin… He's butchering it. Could you just let me… [As Chris Rock] Every time… Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass… [Bleep] I take care of my kid!
Wait a second.
[Bleep] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
Stop it!
[As Chris Rock] What you want a cookie?

Now, this is a simple acronym. HERO. Uh, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but that's not all it takes to be a hero.
Oh, great. Well, what is a hero to you?
A hero kills people, people that wish him harm.
OK.
A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.
Ok, you're thinking of a superhero.
We all have a hero in our heart.
Now, I need you to take these forms. This kind of expresses the joint experience we had today. And I need you to look 'em over and sign them as kind of a group pledge.
[Clears throat] I don't think I can sign this.
I can't leave until you do.
Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so… I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so… Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
Michael, can I talk to you candidly?
Sure.

We both know that I’m here because of the comments you made.
Here’s the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of… racial awareness and it’s probably more advanced than you’re used to. That’s probably throwing you off a little bit.
Um, it’s not throwing me. I need your signature.
OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
Yes, but you’re not listening to me. Yours is the only signature I need.
OK.
Those are my instructions from the Corporate offices to put you through this seminar for the comments that you made. The reason I made copies for everyone was so you wouldn’t be embarrassed.
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don’t.
Don’t worry about dating.
I won’t.
OK. Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, hi. Is Mr. Decker around? Oh, well, could you just have him call me after lunch? Thank you.
“I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart.” I do believe… in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look… the guy, “Mr. Brown,” he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don’t. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn’t see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I’m going to have you all in tears.

All right? Everybody pretty? Come on. Here we go. It’s time. Let’s do some good.
Hey, we’re not all going to sit in a circle Indian style are we? [Laughing]
Get out.
I’m sorry.
No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let’s go. Let’s do it. Come on. Let’s have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um… thanks for coming in. Um… Diversity… is the cornerstone of progress as I’ve always said. But don’t take my word for it. Let’s take a look at the tape.

OK. Questions? Comments? Anybody? Jim?
Uh, is that it?
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I’m going to add on to it later on.
It was kind of hard to hear.
Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um…
I have a customer meeting.
Yeah, well, if you leave we’ll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let’s get down to business and why don’t I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
What part Native American?
Two fifteenths.
Two fifteenths, that fraction doesn’t make any sense.
Well, you know what, it’s kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let’s get this popping. Come on. Who’s going? Who’s going? Let’s go here. Oscar, right here. You’re on.
OK, Michael, um… Both my parents were born in Mexico.
Oh, yeah…
And, uh, they moved to the United Sates a year before I was born. So I grew up in the United States.
Wow.
My parents were Mexican.
Wow. That is… That is a great story. That’s the American Dream right there, right?
Thank… Yeah…
Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
Mexican isn’t offensive.
Well, it has certain connotations.
Like what?
Like… I don’t… I don’t know.
What connotations, Michael? You meant something.
No. Now, remember that honesty…
I’m just curious.
…empathy, respect… [Phone ringing] Jim! Jim!
Hello? Hello?

Oh this is a good one.
Um, hi. How are you?
Fine. How are you?
Great.
Push it.
I admire your culture’s success in America.
Thank you.
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
Who am I supposed to be?
No, that was inadvertent. We didn’t actually plan that.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn’t help me.
Um… Shalom. I’d like to apply for a loan.
That’s nice, Dwight.
OK, do me. Something stereotypical so I can get it really quick.
OK, I like your food.
Outback steakhouse. [Australian accent] I’m Australian, mate!
Pam, come on. “I like your food.” Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let’s do it. Let’s get ugly. Let’s get real.
OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.
Oh, man, am I a woman?

Hey.
Hey.
You wanna go to the beach?
Sure.
You wanna get high?
No.
I think you do, mon.
Stop…
OK. All right. No. It’s good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.

[Voice raised, Indian accent] Kelly, how are you?
I just had the longest meeting.
Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my… [slap!]
[trying not to cry] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it’s like to be a minority.

I just hated it when that guy was in here. Mr. Brown, if that was his real name. I mean, he had never met any of us before, and here he was telling us how to do our thing. I just wanted… I just wanted to do it our way. You know? On our own. Man I should have gotten some food.
[Itialian accent]Maybe some spagh-etti.
Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn’t it? If I’d brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
It’s collard greens.
What?
It’s collard greens.
That doesn’t really make sense. Because you don’t call them collared people, that’s offensive. Hmmm… OK, well, it’s after five. So… Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.

Thanks for filling these out. I promise this will be quick. We only have about an hour.
Yeah. I would like to see us erase 100 years of racism in an hour.
Does this company have 100 years to erase?
No, the country.
Oh right, more like 200 years.
Yeah, more like a 1,000.
Okay, um. Uh, I’ll try to make this quick.

HERO, at Diversity Today, we believe it is very easy to be a HERO. All you need are honesty, empathy, respect and open-mindedness.
I just think that HERO? It’s cute, but it’s… It’s empty, you know? It’s easy. Dwight, you know what, I came up with some terms of my own. Could you put these on the board? The first one is Inclusion, New Attitudes, Color-blind…
Oh, nice.
Expectations….
Good.
Thank you. Sharing…
Great.
And tolerance.
Beautiful.
Um, that spells incest.
Oh, my sorry. That is not appropriate.
Well, it’s not ideal but you have to give me some credit ’cause I made it into a word.
Yeah, but it’s not appropriate. This is not helpful as a memory aid.
I will give you a number of reasons why it is, actually. Okay, first, incest is bad. Racism is bad. No brainer, right? Two, incest. We’re all a family, right? We’re all brothers and sisters. Racial message? Um? Number three, and this is a fact. The states where they have a lot of racism are the states where they have a lot of incest. Okay? And finally…
Okay, Michael, I just…
No, no, no, no, wait. Final one, final one this is important. The more we can encourage interracial dating as a society the further away we get from incest, literally.

Does anyone have anything else at all? Anyone besides Michael?
I have something.
Yes, please.
Um, well I grew up here in Scranton and when I was a kid the guy who lived next door was a former baseball player, who actually played pro ball before the leagues were integrated. And he had the most incredible stories about…
Okay. I’m sorry, I’m sorry this guy’s a temp and I should’ve told you that.
No, no, no, no. An outsider’s perspective would probably be pretty helpful.
Yeah, but no, seriously. Uh, you know, he’s not a member of the full staff so, uh, Ryan you wanna just step outside?
What do you want me to do?
Well, maybe you should go down to the parking lot. You know what. Yes, go down to the parking lot and check to se if any of our guests have parked in the handicapped spots. Cool? ‘Cause the handicaps get a raw deal. Oh, you know what. That ties right into New Attitudes. New attitudes about handicap people. Very important.
I’m sorry, Michael. We’re actually out of time.

Are we going? [Dwight puts four fingers in front of the camera to start a countdown] Don’t do that. Just say action when we’re ready.
Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott, Diversity Tomorrow, take four. And action.
[mumbling] Should I… turn, no. Do it again.
Diversity Tomorrow, take five. Action.
Hi. I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I’m also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, “If you’re a racist, I will attack you with the North.” And those are the principles… Damn it. Okay, sorry. Don’t laugh; please don’t laugh this time Dwight. You’re… it’s, it’s bugging me. Let me give myself a countdown, ready? Three, two, one.
Take six.
Just let me do it! God! Three, two, one. Hi. I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton… Keep the camera steady please! People are gonna get sea sick watching this. Ready? Three, two, one.
Action.
Don’t. Please don’t say anything. [sighs] Oh, God.
And action… Lights, camera, action. Whenever you’re ready.
Could I count myself down please, Dwight. Three, two, one. Hi. I’m Michael Scott. I’m in charge of Dunder Mifflin Paper Products here in Scranton, Pennsylvania but I’m also the founder of Diversity Tomorrow, because today is almost over. Abraham Lincoln once said that, “If you’re a racist, I will attack you with the North.” And those are the principles that I carry with me in the workplace.
Cut.

[takes his ‘Dwight’ race off his forehead] Damn it, Jim! That’s not funny, Jim!
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
It didn’t have anything to do with race.
Okay, all right. Let’s keep on track. Keep on point. Let’s do it.

Try my googi, googi. [Lowering voice] Try my googi, googi. [High-pitched voice] Try my googi, googi. Try my… [Kelly slaps Michael] All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Kelly thank you. [claps] She’s not here, but she gets it. That’s what we have been looking for. The whole time. [trying not to cry] Oh, man. This is what I thrive on. You know? It’s like Don Rickles on acid, man. Right?
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
What, huh?
What card was she?
I think she wasn’t wearing a card.
It’s good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let’s keep it rolling. Let’s round it up.

Pam. Pamela. Pam-elama-ding-dong. Making copies.
I’m not making any copies.
Let’s go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
Nothing new.
Lay them on me. What?
There’s nothing new.
That’s not what you said earlier.
Oh, do you want me to repeat the messages that I gave you before for the… [nods toward camera]

So, which health plan have you decided on?
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Wait, acupuncture? None of the plans have acupuncture. Have you looked at them closely Michael?
I think it was you who didn’t look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
The Gold Plan? I’m not even on that plan.
Well, I’d recommend it. It’s very good.
Michael.
You gotta crack these things open.
You know the whole reason that we’re doing this, is to save money. So you just need to pick a provider and choose the cheapest plan.
Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um… It won’t be popular decision around the old orifice.
It’s your job. So…
Well, it’s a suicide mission, you know.
Michael… maybe… I mean…
There, there…
Sometimes a manager, like yourself, has to deliver the bad news to the employees. I do it all the time.
[scoffs] When have you ever done that?
I’m doing it right now. To you.

Last night on Trading Spouses, there’s… have you seen it?
No. I have a life.
Interesting, what’s that like?
You should try it sometime.
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is…
[laughs]… your problem.
Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.

There’s a decision that needs to be made, and I’m having an unbelievably a busy day. So I’m going to let you pick a health care plan for our office and then explain it to your co-workers.
Gosh.
Yeah!
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
Really?
Yeah. I just don’t think this is the kind of task, that I… am going to do. You know who would be great for this?

OK, first, let’s go over some parameters. How many people can I fire?
Ah, none. You’re picking a health care plan.
OK, we’ll table that for the time being. Two, I’ll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
[to self] Yes, I have an office. [to camera] Bigger than his.
Nope, you cannot use it.
OK, I take it back, it’s a workspace.
Temporary workspace. You can use it.
Thank you.

Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.
[on phone] Pam, Michael Scott. How’s tricks?
Where are you?
Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I’m busy, busy, busy. Can’t step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody’s doing. Everybody cool out there?
Actually, people are really unhappy. Um, Dwight sent around this memo and people are freaking out ’cause the…
Pam! Whoa, whoa, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I’m getting a call.
No you’re not.
I have to make a call after I finish… my work. You know what? Uh, just don’t let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I’m just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
OK.
Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
Still no one calling.

Michael, can I talk to you?
Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Michael. Michael, please, can we talk to you about this memo?
Ah, what? Which memo?
Dwight’s health care memo. I told you about it.
Is it a good plan?
It’s a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
It’s like a pay decrease.
Michael, he made huge cuts.
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
Yeah, you said…
No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don’t you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
I can handle that.
OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there’s some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?

You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.
Where are you going?
Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings. [Giggles] Couldn’t find the knob.

So, basically, I want to do something nice for my employees. Atlantic City, OK? They have this thing where they send a bus, right, for free. Picks everybody up, you head down there, get to the hotel, room is comped, they give you a pile of chips, and your food, everything just kind of all-inclusive, free kind of weekend.
I don’t know of anything like that, but, um, you know what you might want to do, is just call those casinos directly. Um, maybe?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so…

[on his cell phone] Calling you to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, trying to give the troops around here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could take them down to take a spin on your big ride.
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It’s not really a ride.
Its says here that it’s a 300ft drop.
It goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
So it’s not a free fall?
It’s an industrial coal elevator.
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what… you got laser tag or something?

Hey, hey, everybody, Ice-cream sandwiches! Aaaahh! [laughs] Here you go. Take one, take one. It’s all good. Phyllis, think fast. Ya-bome! Oh, oh, I see Angela. Angela? Right? Waaaaah! Oh, hey temp. Why don’t you take two? Because you don’t get health care. And uh, faster metabolism.
Did you get the kind with the cookies? Instead of the…
Why don’t you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
Oh, thanks.
There you go.
This isn’t the big surprise, is it? Because we’ve been having a pretty horrible day.
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn’t the surprise. It’s surprising, um… because you didn’t expect it. But you will… you’ll know it when you see it.
Michael. Michael?
[under his breath] Oh, Christ.

Well?
Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
OK, the health care plan.
Why did you put Dwight in charge of that? He did a horrible job.
Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
I most certainly did not.
Oh come on! That’s horrible! Aaah… Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and… what time is it, what time is it? [looks at watch] Ah, it’s after five. Oh, oh it’s awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
What about the surprise?
Oh… Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
We all think you don’t have a surprise.
All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And… here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is… Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll… Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!

Michael I need to talk to you.
Sorry, too busy can’t even come to the door.
[opens door] Michael.
Yeah, no… [hurries to get up from chair]
Michael, Michael I… [blinds rustle] … inside.
You know what. I, um, I’m out the door. I’m going to a meeting. Pam, I’m headed out to another meeting. So see you later. Uh, here we go.

Well, it is time to call in a little favor. A buddy of mine runs this tourist attraction, actually it’s big. It’s probably one of the most popular in the state. So…
Hello.
[on his cell phone] Hey, hey Craigers, my man! It is Michael Scott here. [silence] Dunder Mifflin, we supply your office paper.
Oh, I think we already did our order this month.
No, no, no, no. No, actually to ask you a little favoroonie my friend. Um, here’s the deal. Um, trying to give the troops here a little bit of a boost. And I was thinking that maybe we could bring them down to go on your big ride.
You mean the elevator that takes you down into the mineshaft? It’s not really a ride.
Well, it says here that it’s a 300ft drop.
Well, it goes 300 feet into the earth, but it moves really slowly.
So it’s not a free fall?
It’s an industrial coal elevator.
Uh, okay. So um, once you get down into the mine, what do you do? Is it like, uh… Do you have laser tag down there or something?
No, you just look around. It’s a historically preserved coal mine.
That’s it?
Well, there’s the adjacent Anthracite Heritage Museum. They got some really interesting old mining tools. There’s also a photo mural exhibit. Uh, bat guano sculpture. [Michael hangs up cell phone]
Uh, he’s a small client. They don’t really buy much.

Oh, um… Jan wants you to call her.
We’re all going bowling!

Michael!?
Oh! God. Dwight, come on…
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
There’s no downsizing.
I, but if there were, I’d be protected as assistant regional manager?
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
Yeah, so I don’t have to worry?
Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn’t guarantee it if there’s downsizing, okay?
But there’s no downsizing, so just don’t…
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.

Get set for Operation Morale Improvement starring Michael Scott. Now, I think I have had a little stroke of genius in that I have had my assistant Pam… Smile, Pam. I have had her go out and find out whose birthday is coming up, so we can have a little celebration for it. Not bad, not bad at all. All right. And the birthday person is… drum roll please. Here we go, who is the birthday, birthday person?
Who is it? Who’s the birthday?
Um… Actually, we don’t have any staff birthdays coming up.
Next person on the…
Oh.
…calendar.
Okay, umm… that would be Meredith.
Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
But it’s not until next month.
Um… uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it’ll be a surprise.
You still want to have a party?
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
[grabs cell phone off desk] Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.

These are my party-planning beeyatches. Pulled off an amazing ’80s party last year. Off the hook!
So I was thinking, if you haven’t already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
Meredith’s allergic to dairy, so…
She’s not the only one that’s going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It’s not, uh, it’s not just about her, so…
It is… her birthday.
Mint chocolate chip! That’d be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?

[staring at birthday card] Meredith, Meredith… Meri… Mary had a little lamb. Mary… Meredith had a little lamb. Don’t bring that lamb to work or it’ll poop on the floor.
Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What’s up?
Uh, I’m sorry to bother you.
Oh, not at all. Come on in. What’s going on?
My nephew is involved with, um, a charity for cerebral palsy, and I was wondering if maybe you’d like to… you know… if…
What?
Donate to the charity?
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Thank you.
No, I’m always good… for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you… $25.
That’s… that’s… that’s very generous.
Oh, my gosh, well… Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into… morale. That’s what I say, so…

[looking at birthday card] Meredith, bad breath. Meredith has bad breath.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
I don’t think she’d be missed.
There’s not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
She had a hysterectomy.
[laughs] Which one is that again?
That’s where they remove the uterus.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I’m trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
It could be kind of funny.
You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just… OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I’ll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time

Michael? Are you done yet?
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let’s go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.

Surprise!
Oh! Surprise.
No, it’s ah…
It’s surprise Meredith. One, two…
[tunelessly] Happy birthday to you.
Find a key.
Happy birthday…

Last year, five years ago…
You were surprised, weren’t you?
Yes.
You looked freaked, man. We said “Surprise.” You were, like, “What?” “What the hell’s goin’ on here?” Good cake. Why don’t you have some?
Uh, I can’t. Um…
Come on. A little bit.
I can’t eat dairy.
Oh, right. God, too bad. It’s so good.
Yeah, it makes me sick.
You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I’d kill myself. ‘Cause this is way, way too good.

Jim, good party, huh? Just a little something I whipped up. You know, a little morale boost. No big deal.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar’s charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
Well, you know, money isn’t everything Jim. It’s not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you’ll give more than three dollars next time.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It’s gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So… God, I can’t even calculate what you’re gonna have to give.
Is Oscar around?

I just thought it was kind of a flat, you know… 25 dollar, one-time donation. I didn’t think it was per mile kinda deal. You know, so…
Well, that’s what a walk-a-thon is.
I know…
It says it right on the sheet. Look, look at the sheet. It says, “However many dollars per mile.”
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um…
I just think it’s kind of cheap to un-donate money to a charity.
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn’t what I wasn’t, that wasn’t… No. It-it-it’s not about the money. It’s just… it… it’s the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How’s your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Yeah.
How many miles did he do last year?
Last year, he walked 18 miles.
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.

Happy Birthday. [gives Meredith her card]
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
“Happy Bird-day” Um… “Meredith, good news. You’re not actually a year older because you work here, where time stands still.”
[under his breath] I don’t know about that.
That was Stanley. “Meredith, happy birthday, you’re the best. Love, Pam.”
[pretends to vomit] Huh! Thanks, downer.
This is from Michael. “Meredith, let’s hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.”
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you’re gettin’ old.
No, I… I get it. It’s funny.
[laughs] You didn’t get the joke. So, that’s cool. That’s, you know what? Actually… I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn’t use. Um… Oh, where’s that? Oh, OK, here’s a good one. Um… “Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.” ‘Cause Meredith’s been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
You’re right. You’re right. Yes.
Divorce. Um… OK, “Meredith is so old…”
How old is she?
Everybody? If… could do it? “Meredith is so old…”
How old is she?
“She’s so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.”
That wasn’t even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don’t get mad at me.
Uh, nice party Michael.
This isn’t my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.
Phyllis wanted red, I didn’t.
Oh, boy… You…
OK, we… all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we’re losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are… a group of people… who work together. I was… I really wasn’t gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar’s nephew’s… walkathon. $25.
Per mile.
Per mile, yes.

[telephone rings] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. Hold please.
All righty then, well I see you’re going for the whole bored supermodel thing. “Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. May I help you?” [takes a drag from an imaginary cigarette] Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke.
I wasn’t really going for anything.
No, no. I get it, I get it, I get it. A child is born, “Oh, oh-hum.” A beautiful sunset, “No, I’ll catch the next one.” Right? Unicorn walks into the office, “Oh, do you have an appointment?” [laughs] Okay, look Pam this is not meant as a criticism, but let me tell you what you’re doing wrong. You are the voice of this company, right? And when clients call and you’re not smiling they can hear that in your voice. It is a real turnoff.
Are you being serious?
Yes, I am, absolutely. So, the next call we get I’d like you to smile. I’d like to see a big smile.
Okay.
Okay. [waits for call]
No one’s calling.
I know, somebody will. And we’ll wait.
Sometimes there’s a lot of time between the calls.
I know, I know, we will wait.
Okay.
We will wait for the call and you will smile. Let me try something, just while we’re waiting.
Okay.
Tell me if I’m smiling or not. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you? Was I smiling?
Yes.
Okay, let me try this one. [covers face with hands] Hi Pam, how are you?
No.
I mean you can tell.
Yeah, I could tell.
I wasn’t smiling that time and they can tell too.
That was a good example.
Thank you. All right, when we get a call I’ll come back and you’ll do the smile.
Okay. [telephone rings]
Show time! It’s show time!
[smiling] Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam. One moment I’ll transfer you.
Okay.

Do a poem for Meredith’s birthday or uh, limerick. Limerick. Um, [knock on door] there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Come on in. Who had a big, smifflin.
Hi, do you mind if I sign the card real quick?
No, not at all come on in. [Toby signing the birthday card] No, no. You can’t. No, red hair is my area. We have it on tape, so…
It’s just a birthday card.
I was going to put that in my message, Toby. All right? So just cross it off. Cross it off, now. [Toby writes on birthday card] What are you doing? Oh come on, you’re ruining it. Toby, come on. Just, look at that. That’s wrecked. Ass. Get some white out.
There’s some right there.
That’s my white out. Get your own white out. Just… what’s the matter with you? God. [Toby leaves] Okay, um, there was a girl from Dunder Mifflin. Who had a big, puttifflin. [thinking out loud] Mifflin, spifflin.

Hey.
Hey.
You wanted to see me?
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
I don’t think she’d be missed.
There’s not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
She had a hysterectomy.
Which one is that again?
That’s where they remove the uterus.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I’m trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
It could be kind of funny.
[sighs] Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Mmm-hmm.
Help me out here.
Okay. Hey Meredith, where’s your uterus?
No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity? [cut to Jim holding his hands up like a champion]
What?
From the downsizing.
There’s not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I’m… I’ll work it out. Thank you Dwight. [Dwight leaves] Thanks for coming in, that’s always… Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.

Meredith. Oh, oh man, ah gosh. I can’t remember why I came over here. Ha, ha.
I hate that.
I know. Ugh, that is so annoying. [makes fart noise] Brain fart. By the way, do you remember any funny interactions we may have had recently that I’ve forgotten about? Just, you know we bumped into each and you said, “Brr, brr.” And I went, “Argh, Argh.” You know? Anything? [shakes her head ‘no’] Well, if you think of something, let me know. ‘Cause I like to know. ‘Cause I’m going crazy.

Oscar, uh for future reference just think you should know, that you should probably make it clear that your nephew is doing the walkathon and that he doesn’t actually have cerebral palsy. Okay.
I never suggested…
No, no. I know you didn’t intend to, but I just I got the idea and I, uh, I just don’t it has a lot of ethical merit to make people think something. You know? And then prey on their emotions.
Michael, if I gave you…
No, hey it’s just kinda uncool, okay? I, just… Play fair, you know, play fair.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.

“Meredith, let’s hope the only downsizing that happens to you is that someone downsizes your age.”
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you’re gettin’ old.
No, I…I get it. It’s funny.
[laughs] You didn’t get the joke. So, that’s cool. That’s, you know what? Actually… I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn’t use. Um… Oh, where’s that? Oh, Okay, here’s a good one. Um…”Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back.” ‘Cause Meredith’s been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
You’re right. You’re right. Yes.
Divorce. Um… Okay, “Meredith is so old…”
How old is she?
If everybody… could do it? “Meredith is so old…”
How old is she?
“She’s so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her.”
[clears throat] What’s the difference between Meredith and Michael Jackson? Michael Jackson’s surgery was unnecessary.
You’re talking about my hysterectomy.
Yes! Thank you. God. She gets it. [laughs] We just picked the best one right? Just had it.
[whispering] I’m so sorry. [Angela, Phyllis, and Pam all whispering] … seriously, we’re just…
Um, no, no. Come on. No. Don’t comfort… don’t comfort her, that’s not… She doesn’t need comforting. We’re just joking around. I think she’s… No that’s very unprofessional. I think she’s being very unprofessional over there.

[to Jim]: Hey, you ready?
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan. [Ryan holds up his bag] Very good. Excellent, excellent.
Michael!

Michael: Pam, Pam, thank you ma’am. Messages, please. Thank you.
Dwight: Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
Michael: No. And that’s not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
Dwight: Oh, please.
Michael: [to camera] When I let him come to my pick-up game…
Dwight: I apologized for that.
Michael: [to Dwight] I vouched for you.
Dwight: Michael, I…
Michael: I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here’s what I’m going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
Dwight: I can handle that.
Michael: Good. Excellent, it’ll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we’re going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody’s gonna want to do it and I know everybody’s gonna complain and bitch and I don’t want to have to deal with that.
Dwight: And that’s why you have an assistant regional manager.
Michael: Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
[to camera] Same thing.
No, it’s not. It’s lower, so…
It’s close.

All right, managing by walking around. This is our warehouse. Or, as I like to call it, the whorehouse. But don’t you call it that, I’ve earned the right.
Fine, don’t worry about that.
And here we have “Mister Roger’s Neighborhood.” Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He’s temping upstairs.
What’s up?
And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
It’s not my real name.
No, it’s Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
Darryl Rogers?
Darryl Philbin. Then Regis, then Rege, then Roger, then Mister Rogers.
[laughs] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
Yeah, yeah.
You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it’s part of the job! Rapport!

So, um, one o’clock sharp and we’ve got a game on.
We’re loading at one.
Oh, I see, you’re chickening out on me. You’re bailing on me.
No, we got a truck going out at 1:15. So, that’s the busy time.
Oh, well, I’m glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I’m down here it doesn’t seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can’t take it. OK, fine, have it your way. [clucking and dancing like a chicken]
All right, fine, you know what? One o’clock.
All right, see you at one.

Are we ready for the game?
[half-heartedly] Yeah.
I… yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Gimli.
Nerd. That is why you’re not on the team.
Just trying to be helpful.
Uh, [in a nerdy voice] “I’ll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword.”
That’s him.
OK, so, let’s put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
I’m sorry?
Um, what do you play? Center?
Why “of course”?
Uh…
What’s that supposed to mean?
Uh, I don’t know. I don’t remember saying that.
Uh, I heard it.
Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um… other starters… Me, of course. I heard it that time.
I’d like to play if it’s just for fun. I played basketball in school.
[ignores Phyllis)] Um… Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
But, I’m getting paid to skip lunch?
Yes.
OK.
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
I can help out, if you need me.
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
I have a hoop in my driveway.
No.
I have a sports bra.
No, no, ridiculous.
Michael, look. [Dwight throws paper at the garbage can]
it…
Close. All right, uh… Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
Yes!
Sorry Phyllis.
Can I be team captain?
No, I’m team captain.
Can I be team manager?
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
Assistant team manager?
No.
OK, we’ll see who’s working this weekend then.
Jim, you’re in charge of the vacation schedule now.
Oh my God.
Threat neutralized.

[hits Pam in the head with a piece of paper] Off the backboard!
Please don’t throw garbage at me.
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
I don’t think so Michael. Besides, I can’t cheer against my fiance.
I’ll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and…
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Maybe Angela would cheerlead.
Oh, yeah right.
I’ll do it.
Oh, yuck, that’s worse than you playing. … ‘Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That’s where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you’re on the team! All right, cool! Very good.

Oh-oh. Oh-oh. A spy from the warehouse. Trying to figure out our plays, huh, man?
Just getting a tea bag.
Oh ho, oh, he’s running. He’s running. He’s running, but he can’t hide because you know what? One o’clock, you better bring your ‘A’ game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
Why don’t we make it more interesting? Loser buys dinner at Farley’s.
Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I’m gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
No, that’s not as much fun. You know what?
What?
You’re on.
OK. Cool, you’re on. [to Dwight] Don’t screw this up

Hey, there he is! Secret weapon! All right, guys, come on, let’s bring it in! Here we go! OK, listen, this is just going to be a friendly game, right? We are all on the same team here, the Dunder Mifflin team. Of course, if you beat us, you’re fired. That’s a joke. OK, let’s do it.
Have a good game man.
Yeah, you too. Should be fun.
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
I stretched before I came.
OK.

OK, Ryan, you have Darryl. I have Roy.
Really? I thought I’d take Roy.
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got… Um…OK, all right, you guys.
[taking off his shirt] OK, we’ll be skins!
Aw, come on Dwight.
What? Shirts on or off?
On. Just put it on.
You sure?
Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don’t you do the uh, jump ball OK?
Don’t listen to him Pam. Trust me, tip it my way or you’re sleeping in the car.
Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?! [Roy steals the ball, and goes for a lay up] Oh… Here we go! [Lonny shoots and makes it] Who’s on him? Somebody get him!
Yeah!
That’s what I’m talking about.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here. [Jim saves the ball from going out of bounds and passes to Michael] Here we go. Three! [Shoots and misses] Let’s go to the zone! We’re going to zone!
De-fense! [clap, clap] [Michael joins in] De-fense! [clap clap]
De-fense! De-fense!
[Roy scores] Well done team.
Who’s got Roy? [Jim does a behind the back move around Roy for the basket]
Woo!

[Roy bumps Michael to get around him] OK, foul. Charging. Charging. That’s a foul.
OK.
OK, I’ll take it. [misses free throw] OK.

Jim! Jim! Jim, right here, Jim! Give me the ball! Ryan, cut! [Michael looks away and misses Jim’s pass] Whoa!
My bad.
[scores] Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
[dancing] Where you at? Where you at? You over there? I’m over there.
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?

[Ryan scores] Nice! Come here! [gives Ryan a chest bump]
Can we just do one? That’s cool, that’s fine.
You have one more free throw shoot. Come on.
All right, let’s go.

Watch your back Madge.
Hey! Come on man!
Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
[scores] Yeah! [points to Madge] In your face!
Yeah, like that counts.
You know what? Dwight, Dwight…

[singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Du-du-du-du-dupee-do, de-do-do-do. Harlem Globetrotter…
[steals the ball, scores, mimics singing] Du-du-du-du-dupee-do. Your ball.
All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
What’s going on? What’s going on? You’re playing like a bunch of girls.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.

Block, block, block!
He’s afraid of you now.
[Jim makes a shot after pushing off Roy] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?

[Jim pushes Roy to the ground and makes another shot] Yes!
What the hell man?
Take it easy.
No, you take it easy.

[Dwight steals the ball from Ryan] Same team, Dwight.
Dwight!
[scores] Yes!

[Phyllis scores] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! In, your, face! Angela, what’s the score?
You’re ahead.
Yeah, baby, here we go!
[Jim has the ball] Jim! Jim! Right here! [runs into the elbow of the guy guarding him] Ow! God! Hold it!
I’m sorry.
Foul! Foul!
I’m sorry. You all right?
Oh, that hurts.
Sorry, I didn’t mean to do that.
What’s your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
Take your shot man!
No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
No it wasn’t.
[mocking voice] Yes, it was. You know what, I’m just being fair.
Oh, really? No, I just put my arm up…
Game over. Game over. That is it! I’m sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that’s just… we’re having a friendly game. It’s a shame. This is a damn shame, but we’re like a family here and that just, that won’t fly.
This is a cold pack…
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag. [bag explodes]
Thanks Dwight.
Wait, what does that mean? What is it, a tie? What’s going on?
Well, let’s just say whoever was ahead won.
That was you.
It was us? Really? I didn’t, I didn’t know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
No, no, no, I’m not coming in on Saturday.
Yeah, this isn’t happening.
Um… well, you guys, you know, I’m the boss so…
So what’s that? We’re coming in on Monday, right?
Hey, hey…
Monday?
[laughing] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would’ve been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I’m embarrassed it was even that close though. So… nah, of course, we’re coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.

Hey, what a game, huh? What a game.
What time do we have to come in?
Come on. Let’s not be gloomy here man. We’re all in this together. We’re a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody’s coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.

[slams palms on desk] Pam, Pam, thank you ma’am. Messages, please. Thank you.
New pants?
Uh, yes. Thank you for noticing.
Abercrombie & Fitch?
Uh, they look that good? Wow. [Mike Myers voice] Oh, Pam please behave. Mike Myers, genius. Um, no actually I got them at a fancier place. Target.
Michael, could I talk to you for a second, please?
Uh…
In your office? [in Michael’s office] You know that is why you have an assistant regional manager.
Yes, yes. Assistant to the regional manager.
[to camera] Same thing.
No, it’s not. It’s lower.
It’s close.
What was that?
What?
That look?
What look?
Like trying to find the camera, to give the camera a look. Okay, we’re done. Is that your stomach? I keep hearing somebody’s stomach. [whispers] God.

So, you uh, see the Sixers game last night?
Yeah.
[howls like a wolf] Oww whoo whoo! The Answer was on fire!
Iverson. Yeah, always man. It’s very important.
Oh, man! Man I tell ya. Iverson has maybe got me beat by like 20 pounds, 3 inches. [makes ‘pop’ noise with his mouth]
What? Iverson’s not fat.
No, neither am I. We both look good

[on the phone] Mello.
Packer. Pac-man.
Whoa. Hey.
Pac-man [imitating the noises of the video game Pac-man eating dots]
[on the phone] Is this Michael Scott? My secret lover. My intercom, I told you never to call me here. Never! [Michael’s laughing]
I’m not your lover! I’m am not Michael Scott, I am Dr. Bergerstein. Your proctologist.
[on the phone] Bergerstein!
Ah, yes. Ah. [laughs]
[on the phone] Bergerstein!
It’s not a Jewish joke, so don’t worry.
[on the phone] I want my money back you greedy Hebrew. Bergerstein!
[clears throat] No, hey, hey , hey. You know what I just wanted to remind you about the game today. One ‘o clock. Big game, big game.
[sounds sick on the phone] I can’t make it.
Mmm. No, you said you could man. We’re counting on ya. You know you’re playing point guard.
[on the phone] I… I’m not coming.
No. Hey… I mean, although it’s just for fun, you know we want… I was counting on you man.
[on the phone] Oh, God! Stop whining. You know, you only come to the pick up game once a year. You little bitch. [Michael picks up phone, takes it off speakerphone] All right, yup. Hey, okay. No problem, you know, best you can do. Hey, you know. Hey, nice talking to you too. All right take care. [sighs] Michael Scoot. That’s funny. He’s a good friend.

[back to the basketball game] Dwight, pass it to Jim! Pass it to Ryan!
Oh, my ankle!
Stanley, gotta play hurt.
Oh, actually no I don’t Michael.
I just want you know, you’ve been a big disappointment to me today, okay.
[in pain] Oh. Go away.
I’m in. I’m in. Here we go. [Lonny gets around Michael to score and he ends up in front of Phyllis] Zone, Phyllis! We’re playing zone!

Are you listening to me Michael?
Affirmative.
What did I just say?
You just said, let me uh… check my notes. You just said…
Alan and I have created an incentive program to increase sales.
Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
I’m not going to do that Michael.
Okay
We’ve created an incentive program to increase sales.
Uh, huh.
At the end of the month you can reward your top seller with a prize worth up to a thousand dollars.
Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That’s cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
Uh, yes. Yes you can.
Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that’ve been promoted to…
No, Michael. No. You can’t win this prize.
I didn’t mean me!

Well, first what we have to do is find out what motivates people more than anything else.
Sex.
It’s illegal. Can’t do that. Next best thing.
Torture.
Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That’s just stupid.
Uh, Michael?
Pam!
Hey, there’s a…
Burger with cheese!
There’s a person here…
And fries!
There’s…
And shake! What? Go ahead.
There’s a person here who wants to sell handbags.
No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
Okay, I told her you’d talk to her.
Pam. Pam. Come on, I’m busy. So just tell her to go away.
Okay.
[exhales loudly, looks out window and sees Katy] Oooh, alright I’ll talk to her

This one is hand embroidered.
All right girls break it up, you’re being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
Cocks in the henhouse.
Don’t say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
Katy.
Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you’re like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I’m against violence in the workplace.
So am I.
Nobody cares what you think.
Doesn’t matter.
So uh, you know what? I usually don’t allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It’s yours. All day.
Wow, thanks.
There’s an HR meeting in there at 11:30.
Well, lets put ’em in the hallway. Give ’em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.

Michael: This is my conference room. So please, uh, make yourself at home. Whatever you need, I’m right on the other side of this wall. [knocks on wall] used to be a window here. There’s not anymore. So, that’s where I will be.
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don’t hesitate to ask. I’m right here.
I guess a cup of coffee would be great.
Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the ‘bucks.
What?
It’s like a slang for Starbucks. They’re all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don’t have the good stuff here.
Regular coffee is fine.
Nah, it’s not. it’s spppplllibbb
No really it is.
No, here’s the thing. Y’know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they’re always putting up walls and I’m always tearing ’em down, just breakin’ down barriers, that’s what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
Bring it on.
Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.

[handing Katy a mug of coffee] There ya go. Nice steaming cup o’joe.
Thank you.
I have an idea. Why don’t I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
Gosh, I would love to but, my purses, I should, um…
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
I’m installing File Share on all the computers.
Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right? 

You should sell a lot here because this branch made over a million dollars last year. Not that we’re all millionaires. I’m probably closest. So here’s Oscar. Oscar, this is Katy.
I’m on the phone.
Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
That was on Sesame Street.
I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he’d never heard that before he worked here?
No, I don’t believe that.
I know, it’s unbelievable.

Here is Toby from Human Resources. Katy, Toby.
Hi
Hi, nice to meet you.
Toby, Katy.
Hey, um did you go to uh, Bishop O’Hara?
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Cool. What year were you there?
Eighty-nine.
Toby’s divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
Yeah.
You and your wife, and you have kids.
A girl.
Oh that so – that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
[looks resigned]
I should probably get back to my table.
Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit. [looks at picture on Toby’s desk] Oh, she’s cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work.

This one’s really good for a hot date.
Yeah, what’s that?
[laughs]
I’m engaged. So…
Congratulations. You need a hot date more than anyone.
I wished, right?
Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right? [to Katy] So how’s that uh, coffee from earlier?
Good.
Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
[whispers] Sorry.
Busted.
[to Pam] Come back…
Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
Is that from Starbucks?
Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
Wow. Is that for the office?
Oh, I know what you’re thinking. You’re not prying this out of my hands, but don’t tempt me because I’ll give it to you!
I wouldn’t think of it.

[Katy reading text message on her phone] Oh the rotating um, steam wand. [Katy looks annoyed] What? What’s the matter?
Oh, nothing. My ride just bailed on me.
Oh, oh! God. I’m sorry. Is there…?
Oh no, it’s um…
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
No…
Seriously. No, really.
No. I really don’t want to inconvenience you.
God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I’m out of here at five sharp.
At five?
I can go earlier. ‘Cause I’m the boss. You know, whatever. I’m out of here slaves.
Okay.
What?
Okay, I guess that would be, I guess that would be okay.
Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o’clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
Okay. Cool.
Excellent.
Cool.
Great. Cool. Cool. [takes deep breath – looks at camera] Yeah, okay.

I should have never let the Temp touch this thing. I had all these great icons and now I have four folders. So..
It’s actually better this way.
No it’s not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I’m onto—
Michael could I ask you something? I wanted to ask your permission to ask out Katy. I know it’s against the rules and everything. Because…
No, no, no it’s not against the rules. She’s not a permanent employee so it’s not.
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate this so much.
But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
What?
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
Is that all it is? Just a ride home? Like a taxicab?
Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot…
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I’m asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home?
No. I cannot promise you that.
You cannot promise me, or you won’t promise me?
Listen, Dwight.
Do you love her?
[laughs] Dwight, no. I don’t know. It’s too early to tell. I don’t know how I feel. [Dwight sadly looks away]

I think you’ve made a really good choice, she’s really going to like that.
Hmmm…
Espresso?
Oh, thank you.
You’re welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
Is that from the machine that was in your office?
Ummm-hmmm…
I thought that was the incentive prize for the top salesperson.
Very easy to clean.
Okay. Like he’s going to win anyway, right? [laughs]

Did we get any mail?
Yeah, I gave it to you.
Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin’. Just checkin’, double checkin’, checkin’ on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and…
So, can I..? [points to the door]
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?

Ryan.
Yeah.
Would you like to help me with a special project?
I would love to.
Alright.

[in Michael’s car] Okay, just throw out all the empties.
You don’t want to recycle them?
Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
Do you want this? [holding a full bottle of water]
No.
What about this bottle of power drink?
Uh, what flavor?
Blue.
Blue’s not a flavor.
It says flavor: Blue Blast.
Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.

What, stop! Whoa! That’s my Drakkar Noir.
No, this is Rite Aid Night Swept.
No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I’m not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
Well, it’s empty.
Not it’s not, there’s some in the straw. [Michael opens bottle and wipes straw along his neck] There, now you may throw it out.
Wow. How many filet-o-fishes did you eat?
That’s over several months, Ryan.
[Under his breath] Still.

Sure you don’t want me to help you with that? Cause I can grab that no problem.
Goodnight, it was nice nice to meet some of you.
See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
Goodnight, Michael.
Where you going?
I don’t know. Grab a drink, I think?
With us?
I uh, I probably should have told you, I don’t need a ride now ’cause Jim can take me home after so you’re off the hook.
Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
I got this. [taking Katy’s bag from Michael]
Alright, have fun.
Thanks.
I got it.
Don’t drink and drive.
Take it easy.
Have a good night.
You too, have a good night.
You got that?
Oh, yeah. You sold a lot, so it’s lighter.
Good. Here. Squeeze it inside.
Alright now, I’m gonna warn you. Don’t freak out, okay?
Why?
This is a really nice car. In case you haven’t noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay.
It’s a… it’s a very nice car.
You’re not going to freak out?

This is really well made. Good stitching. Excellent fabric. [shakes the purse from side to side by it’s handle] You sell a lot of these?
It’s very popular, yeah.
I knew it. Is it waterproof?
I’m not sure. It’s faux snakeskin.
Snakes are waterproof. So, I’m betting that it’s waterproof. Do you know the difference between a snake and an eel?
No.
‘Cause I could look it up real easily.
You’re really into reptiles, huh?
My belt’s made out of alligator. Check it out. [lifts shirt]
Oh, um, it’s okay.
Dwight. Dwight. Dwight! Okay, that’s it. Keep it in your pants.
I was just showing her my belt.
Well, don’t do that. Where are your glasses?
I….
He wears glasses. Did you know that?
Not all the time.
Well, now suddenly he can see. [laughs] Okay, take off. See ya. Bye-bye. [gives coffee to Katy] There you go steaming hot cup of joe.
Thank you.
Oh, I know your hero. Yeah, saving you from Animal Planet Jack over there. [laughs]
Ha. Yeah, asks a lot of questions.
Yeah, yeah he is the worst.

Thank you, Al Gore… for the Internet. Can send messages from one side the global to the other in the blink of an eye. Can you believe we couldn’t do that ten years ago?
We could do that ten years ago.
Right, but 20 years ago we couldn’t and that is amazing. Here’s Toby from Human Resources. This is Katy. Toby, Katy.
Hi.
Hi.
Hey, did you go to Bishop Ohara?
Yeah.
Yeah, me too.
Cool, what year where you there?
’89.
Oh.
[talking over Toby and Katy] Toby’s divorced. God, that’s hard. That really ripped you up. She got the kids right? That’ll damage ya. Sorry man. That’s uh, that’s a bad one. How much you paying her? What can, you can’t even afford anything now, right? You’re all right though, right? Don’t ask me for a raise. [laughs] Cup of Soup’s a good idea though. That’ll… that’s a good budgetary thing to do.
It’s just a snack.
Well, they’re good snacks. They’re good food, good meals, good lunch. Roman noodles are good too. You still sleepin’ in the car?
No.
‘Cause he slept in the car a couple times.
Just the once.
Are you still taking the antidepressants? ‘Cause it was a good idea. ‘Cause it’ll help. It’ll help, man.
I’m gonna go back to my table.
Okay. I’ll see you in a bit. [whispering] She’s pretty cute isn’t she? See you in a bit.

All right. That’s looking good. Hey um, Ryan do you have any music I can borrow.
What kind do you like?
Ah, I know, everything really. I love it all. I love music.
Okay, do you like hip-hop? Do you like indie rock?
Yes, I love both of those so much. A lot of ’em.
Okay. Do you like The Strokes?
Mmm hmm. I like ’em.
Do you like The Hives?
Yes. God. They’re awesome.
You like the Fleebulls, The Glorps?
Uh huh. Yup. That last thing they did was great.
Yeah, I had a feeling you would like those.
Cool, so maybe hook me up with some Fleebulls and some Hive.
Absolutely.
All right. This is gonna be good.
